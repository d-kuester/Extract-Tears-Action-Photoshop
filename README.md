# Extract-Tears-Action-Photoshop
This is a custom Photoshop CS6 Action that allows extract, "detach", and duplicate tears from one tearful face to another. This should also work on other watery substances on surfaces where the water drops can be well-removed with the clone tool or similar tools using a copy of the original image. More detailed instructions are included via a demo video.

# Installation

Just download and drag the .atn file into Photoshop. Alternatively, click on the top-right dropdown in Photoshop's action panel, and "Load actions".

A very simple demo file is included where the water drop is already edited out, and the layers are correctly positioned.

# Usage
Watch the <a href="https://owncloud.csl.uni-bremen.de/s/Ad5zsaBjSYb7EQy">demo video</a> for instructions on how to prepare your materials. What you need for a starting point is an image that contains one or more tears. You will first need to create a copy of that image on a new layer, and then edit out the tear you are targeting using the clone tool or the healing brush. Take as much care as you need to get a satisfactory result - but this step is usually quite easy. Then, move the layer with the original image on top of the layer where you have edited out the tear in question. You are now prepared to use the action:

In the Actions panel, click on the action to run, and hit the "Play" button at the bottom of that panel. The set contains only a single version of the action that will take a moment to execute.

Result: The action generates a set of 4 new layers that look nearly black except for the extracted tear(s). These layers contain 4 different versions of the tear(s) that are blended together to create appropriate highlights and shadows produced by the tears. These can now be copied and moved inside the same Photoshop file, moved on top of an entirely different image, or stored for later use. When used with other images, it is recommended to tweak the blend-percentages assigned to the 4 layers to correct for differences in the lighting of both images.
