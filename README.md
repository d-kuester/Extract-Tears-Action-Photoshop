# Extract-Tears-Action-Photoshop
This is a custom Photoshop CS6 Action that allows extract, "detach", and duplicate tears from one tearful face to another. This should also work on other watery substances on surfaces where the water drops can be well-removed with the clone tool or similar tools using a copy of the original image. More detailed instructions are included via a demo video.
